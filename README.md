**Open FTA** is a simple application designed to perform fault tree analysis for safety assessment in the chemical industry. The application serves as a **teaching tool** for educating chemical engineers and as a **free (open-source) alternative** to commercial systems.  

Being open-source allows for further development of the application, verification and auditing of calculations, and adaptation to specific user needs. It can be used in **research projects** and in the **educational process**, for example in courses such as safety engineering.  

The foundation of the application is based on the diploma thesis of M. Doller: [“Design of a Software System for Fault Tree Analysis”](https://kis.cvt.stuba.sk/arl-stu/sk/detail-stu_us_cat-stuzp105108-Navrh-softveroveho-systemu-na-analyzu-stromu-poruch/).

## Key Features

- Calculation of the probability of the top event.  
- Identification of **Minimal Cut Sets (MCS)** and computation of reliability indices.  
- Database browser for easier assignment of basic event frequencies.  
- Three core algorithms for fault tree alignment.  
- Export of analysis results as detailed reports (top event frequency, list of basic events with references, MCS analysis).  
- Export of the tree structure as **bitmap** or **vector graphics**.
